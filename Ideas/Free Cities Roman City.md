A city in the free cities which technically belongs to the [Hegemony](<Countries/The Hegemony>), but as part of the peace treaty, it pays taxes to the free cities but maintains a governing structure similar to the Hegemony. Although it doesn't have admirals and the like, its troops will fight on the orders of the admirals if need be(obviously not if the target is the Hegemony).
