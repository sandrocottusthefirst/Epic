Slightly above average height
Above Average physique 
Inbred aristocrat face
2 modes:

1. Aware of other people mode:

Gregarious, open and still body. Hands move freely and graciously. Radiates warmth
Massive smile/grin, shining eyes
Overall appears larger than life(theater actor)

Although as and when situation demands: 
Will change body language to be more subservient(either kid like look, or down right flatterer: like beer biceps)
Will change body language to languid and large gestures; micro tinges in eye, laser eyes etc.

2. Non present mode:
zoned out look. When speaking with someone limited motion and expression (bare minimum motion of face) but lots of awkward twitching
Self conscious of gait. Keeps changing angle of walk.
 Might try to make postures to look cool but too nervous to stick with one. Postures like pulling stomach muscle in to bump up chest or hands in pocket while leaning against a wall
When talking to someone might forcefully laugh if he is referred directly
