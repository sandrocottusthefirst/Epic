Tall, thin gray hair, lean physique.  
Wrinkled face kind of like ed o neil

Poker-faceed most of the time. Sighs a lot. Discerning eye, will dart about when he notices something. Intensely focused, you have his undivided attention when you speak to him.

Sometimes comes across as gruff and callous. Is straightforward, doesnâ€™t like playing games as far as people who share his allegiance are concerned.
Has a proper military man-esque posture, but is aware enough to be able to turn it off.


He becomes a cautious man after his tactical mistake, his second in command is half blinded because of it. He lets an opportunity go when facing [[Lawdu]] , later obliterates him with full deceit and treachery. He is called honorable for this victory back home, he feels this is a contradiction. His mindset becomes similar to that of Arjuna before bhagvad gita.
