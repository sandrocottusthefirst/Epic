Rookie vasal prince sent to [General](General) for training. Naive person, seeing the subjugation of the riverlanders but not being able to see the terror they inspired before they were defeated, stages a "rebellion"* after manipulation by a riverlord and the [nobleman](Narcissist%20Nobleman.md) in the conquered riverland territories. General is sent to deal with him, but he gets away after being defeated. He becomes permanent allies with the nobleman, and later plays a hand in the rebellion of [raja baja](Raja%20baja%20I.md) 
*-rebellion as in not really hegemony province, but they paid tribute from time to time and were in the hegemony's sphere of influence. So more like an actual war than a civil war.
