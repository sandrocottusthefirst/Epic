 **Antiochus has two sons, among them the elder sturdy, valuing stability, the virtue and honor of maintaining their status. The younger is brash, impatient, ambitious and seeks to carve his name into the annals of history. His unhinged nature is not surpassed even by Antiochus himself. As a parallel to the elder, the older brother of Antiochus also values stability and family honor. As the rift between the sons of Antiochus grows as a result of their differences, Antiochus tries counselling them to get along just as he gets along with his brother in the hopes that they have each other’s backs when times truly call for it.

The younger keeps getting into trouble, and he befriends the Lawyer as he gets him out of trouble time and again. Thus Antiochus can introduce the Lawyer to Darius.

The Lawyer is a character who while currently is getting by fine working as a mediator, contractor, notary and a facilitator of all kinds of activities outside the bounds of City Laws, he thinks his talents are being squandered in the service of nothing. After meeting Darius, perhaps we can make it an episode of him dealing with the kidnapping of Antiochus where he calls upon the Lawyer to help out,he realises this is his chance at being part of history being made.
