The kingdom is a hegemonic structure(akin to the mauryas in a sense), with a high king who has conquered the rest of the land in the roman territory, but a unified military
(non feudal) and bureaucracy. 
This is a sort of feudal world though, and the conflict between vassal states and the hegemony can be brought out.
	All vassal princes are required to join the army, this includes the royal princes.
His house had been the traditional seat of the hegemony for two hundred fifty years, but it had waned for the past 80 90 years, with many sub kingdoms not swearing fealty anymore.

20 30 years ago, the current king set the order back in place, reinstituting the earlier laws and customs which had been forgotten, reconquering lost territory, and in general
reviving the Hegemony. 3 of his siblings serve as some of the highest ranking generals, each of them having played a vital role in the rebirth of the Hegemony. The youngest serves as the Field Marshal.

Among the King's four sisters, 2 of them are in marriage alliances with great powers, one of them serves as chief advisor to the king, and one of them dies(will decide later by what)
The politics between the siblings can also be brought out

The King is also widely regarded to have killed his wife by not saving her when there was a fire. The wife was from a neighboring ally(think athens and sparta when faced with the persians) to the seat of the hegemons. The ally was instrumental in the revival, but it is well known that both the families hate one another. Marital murder has happened before in this lineage, which is also why the theoryÂ  is accepted so widely. He did not actually kill his wife, though this can be revealed later, initially hinting that he did infact do it. He has embraced the reputation it gave him as being unpredictable and fearsome.
